**ðŸ‘‹ Hello world**

I'm Gal, a people's person who's passionate about solving creative challenges.

Living in today's world, I'm fortunate to use code in my pursuit of impactful and scalable solutions.

I believe that in order to deliver a great SaaS product, one needs to understand its full lifecycle.<br />
Thus, I'm excited to take part in system design, infrastructure, data pipelines, APIs, and also frontend development - up to product definitions and strategy. Some research and NLP are also great :)

When I'm not working, I'm a passionate linguist, an [aspiring writer](https://galabra.medium.com) and an amateur cook.
